# Task Description: HackerNews Comment Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This task involves collecting links from the first page of HackerNews using `hn.algolia.com`. Subsequently, all comments for each link are collected using `BullMQ`. The collected sentiment for each link is stored in `Redis`. To optimize efficiency, the system avoids collecting sentiment data if it already exists in the Redis database.

## Steps

1. **Collect Links from HackerNews**:
   - Utilize the HackerNews search API (`hn.algolia.com`) to fetch links from the first page. These links point to various discussions, challenges, or articles on HackerNews.

2. **Collect Comments Using BullMQ**:
   - Implement `BullMQ` to process each link and collect all comments associated with it. `BullMQ` manages the processing queue efficiently, ensuring comments are collected in an organized manner.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Analyze the sentiment of collected comments. Use natural language processing techniques or sentiment analysis libraries to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of each comment.

4. **Store Sentiment in Redis**:
   - Save the calculated sentiment for each link in `Redis`. Before performing sentiment analysis, check the Redis database to avoid redundant analysis for links that have already been processed. If the sentiment data exists, skip the sentiment analysis step for that particular link.

## Technologies Used

- **HackerNews API (`hn.algolia.com`)**: Utilized to collect links from HackerNews's first page.
- **BullMQ**: A Redis-backed job queue library for efficient processing of tasks, in this case, collecting comments associated with HackerNews links.
- **Redis**: A fast, in-memory data structure store used to store link sentiments. Redis enables quick data retrieval and storage, essential for real-time applications.

## Conclusion

By following this workflow, businesses can efficiently collect HackerNews discussion data, analyze sentiments, and store results for strategic decision-making. The combination of `BullMQ` and `Redis` ensures optimized task processing and data storage, enhancing the overall efficiency of the sentiment analysis system.
